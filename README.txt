Features Included :

Necessary features :

1) Modified the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a 
parabolic path. When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it bounces off the ground.

2) Introduced collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet 
hits it. After a collision, the bullet disappears too.

3) Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.

Extra Features :

1)Used bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubble , it splits into smaller bubbles
(half the radius of original bubble), moving in horizontally opposite dirctions, with some initial
velocity in y direction.

2)Implemented 3 different levels of game. In level 1 there are 2 yellow bubbles of default radius . In 
level 2 there are 2 orange bubbles of radius double of default radius. In level 3 there are 2 green 
bubbles of radius 4 times of default radius. Once all buubles are destroyed in a level , we move to 
next level , unless u complete level 3 in which case you win.
